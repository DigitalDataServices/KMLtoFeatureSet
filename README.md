# KML to FeatureSet

Converts Google Earth KML/KMZ data to one or more ArcGIS FeatureSets (one for each feature type) so that it can be passed as an input argument into other workflow activites. This includes a custom DLL and sample workflow for Latitude Geographics Geocortex Workflow Designer.

## Installation

To use a custom workflow module, you will need to copy the DDS.KmlWorkflow.dll to the following directories in your Geocortex Essentials installation:

- `...\Geocortex Essentials\Default\REST Elements\REST\bin`
  - Default path is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Latitude Geographics\Geocortex Essentials\Default\REST Elements\REST\bin\`
  - This location makes the dll available to the REST endpoint and your users.

- `..\Geocortex Essentials\Default\Workflow Designer`
  - Default path is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Latitude Geographics\Geocortex Essentials\Default\Workflow Designer\`
  - This location makes the module available in the Geocortex Workflow Designer.



## Usage

```javascript
var ProjectName = require('project-name')
var projectName = new ProjectName()

// YOUR CODE
```

## Sample Script

## Change Log

List of releases and changes, with the latest at the top.

- v0.20150909
  - [FIX] When multiple geometries are loaded covering a large area, the bounding box is taken from all features and used as the basis to set the initial map extent instead of setting map extent on one particular feature.
  - [BUG] Fixed issue with XML Namespace conflicts with KML files generated by Esri ArcMap which caused XML parsing errors and prevented the KML file from being displayed.
  - [BUG] Adjusted line and polygon endpoint checks to allow non-conforming geomtries to be displayed without causing errors.
  - [BUG] Fix issue that prevented the display of HTML embedded with the <DESCRIPTION> tage with no CDATA enclosure. 

- v0.20150908
  - Initial Release
